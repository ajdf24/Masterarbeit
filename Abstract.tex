\section{Abstract}
This paper deals with the question of how current Augmented Reality and Artifical Intelligence technologies can be used to create a Natural User Interface. The User Interface should only be controlled by gestures and voice commands. The aim of this paper is to clarify if it is possible to create such a software.

It is described how such a Natural User Interface can be evolved based on the ISO 9241 and how it can be developed.
After a comparison of AR and AI technologies, a Natural User Interface is designed, which is then prototypically implemented to prove that such an interface is already possible today.

After the implementation, a conclusion will be drawn in which problems during the development are discussed and how they can be remedied.
